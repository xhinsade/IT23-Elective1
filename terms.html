        <h1>Terms and Conditions for CwinX Housekeeping Agency</h1>
        <p><strong>Last Updated: [Date]</strong></p>
        
        <p>Welcome to CwinX Housekeeping Agency! We’re thrilled that you’ve chosen us to help keep your home clean and organized. Before we get started, we want to make sure you understand how we operate. These Terms and Conditions are here to guide our relationship, ensuring everything runs smoothly.</p>

        <h2>1. Who We Are</h2>
        <p>At CwinX, we pride ourselves on providing high-quality housekeeping services. When we say "we," we’re referring to CwinX Housekeeping Agency, and when we say "you," we mean our wonderful clients.</p>

        <h2>2. Booking Our Services</h2>
        <p>When you book with us, you’re entering into an agreement. We’ll outline the specifics of what we’ll do, how long we’ll be there, and any other important details. If you have special requests, just let us know!</p>

        <h2>3. Payment Details</h2>
        <p>We aim to keep things simple:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Full Payment:</strong> We usually ask for payment upfront before the cleaning starts, unless we agree on something different.</li>
            <li><strong>Payment Methods:</strong> We accept all major credit/debit cards, bank transfers, and cash.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Cancellation Policy</h2>
        <p>Life happens! If you need to cancel, please do so with as much notice as possible. Here’s how it works:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Less than 24 Hours:</strong> If you cancel within 24 hours of your appointment, we’ll need to charge a cancellation fee of [percentage]% of the total service cost.</li>
            <li><strong>More than 24 Hours:</strong> Feel free to reschedule without any penalties—just give us a heads up!</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>5. Taking Care of Your Home</h2>
        <p>We take great care when we’re in your home, but we want to set some expectations:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Our Responsibility:</strong> We’re insured and will do our utmost to protect your property. However, we can’t be liable for damages or losses unless it’s due to our negligence.</li>
            <li><strong>Your Responsibilities:</strong> Please let us know if you have any valuable or fragile items. Also, make sure pets are secured and any health or safety concerns are communicated to us beforehand.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>6. Keeping Your Information Safe</h2>
        <p>Your privacy is important to us. We won’t share your personal information with anyone else unless you give us the go-ahead or we’re required by law.</p>

        <h2>7. Changes to Our Terms</h2>
        <p>Sometimes, we may need to update these terms. If that happens, we’ll make sure to keep you in the loop.</p>

        <h2>8. Our Agreement is Governed by Law</h2>
        <p>These Terms and Conditions are governed by the laws of [your jurisdiction]. If any part of these terms is found to be unenforceable, the rest will remain in effect.</p>

        <h2>9. We’re Here for You</h2>
